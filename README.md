# Gif-tastic

creating a page that deploys gifs from giphy for old movies. 
When the button with the old movie is pressed, the gifs show up (ten, as that is the limit).
when one of the gifs is clicked it will begin to animate, if it is clicked again, it goes to still.
when new button is clicked, a new movie is added.
